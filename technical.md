## Whitepaper

#### Abstract

Current architectures all suffer from a number of issues: Extensibility, scalability and lack of on-chain data availability. Up until now, the primitive nature of the blockchain has posed restrictions on the development of exciting DApps. We believe these problems stem from the relationship between two very important parts of the consensus architecture, namely canonicality and validity, too closely together.

Lack of on-chain resources have put a strain on complex blockchain innovation and use cases. The use of Oracles remove the true purpose of blockchain's core functionality by adding a centralized party to handle off-chain data.

This Rublix whitepaper introduces an architecture which fundamentally sets itself apart from the rest of the existing blockchains by integrating a strategic consensus method for reliable market data accessible on-chain.

Rublix is a trustless and decentralized blockchain which enables real-time market data to be accessed easily through its chain while retaining maximum validity through the utilization of several data sources, and making appropriate final decisions based on arithmetic calculations. This gives traders, fund managers and investors the ability to write smart contracts which will execute based on an underlying market price of choice.

#### Remaining Trustless

We introduce a node layer with real-time market data integration using multiple data sources to reach value consensus.

#### Hybrid Proof of Authority - Proof of Stake Model

The Proof of Authority model provides one of the highest levels of security as an attacker with unwanted connection or hacked authority can not overwhelm the entire network potentially reverting or disrupting all transactions. By allowing a trusted set of individuals to validate blocks, we dramatically lower the risk of malicious nodes trying to alter the chain with false information.

This paper introduces an architecture, the heterogeneous multi-chain,
which fundamentally sets the two apart.
In compartmentalising these two parts, and by keeping the overall functionality provided to an absolute minimum
of security and transport, we introduce practical means of core extensibility in situ. Scalability is addressed through
a divide-and-conquer approach to these two functions, scaling out of its bonded core through the incentivisation of
untrusted public nodes.
The heterogeneous nature of this architecture enables many highly divergent types of consensus systems interoperating
in a trustless, fully decentralised “federation”, allowing open and closed networks to have trust-free access to
each other.
We put forward a means of providing backwards compatibility with one or more pre-existing networks such as
Ethereum. We believe that such a system provides a useful base-level component in the overall search for a practically
implementable system capable of achieving global-commerce levels of scalability and privacy
