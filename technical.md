## Whitepaper

#### Abstract

Current architectures all suffer from a number of issues: Extensibility, scalability and lack of on-chain data availability. Up until now, the primitive nature of the blockchain has posed restrictions on the development of exciting DApps. We believe these problems stem from the relationship between two very important parts of the consensus architecture, namely canonicality and validity, too closely together.

Lack of on-chain resources have put a strain on complex blockchain innovation and use cases. The use of Oracles remove the true purpose of blockchain's core functionality by adding a centralized party to handle off-chain data.

This Rublix whitepaper introduces an architecture which fundamentally sets itself apart from the rest of the existing blockchains by integrating a strategic consensus method for reliable market data accessible on-chain.

Rublix is proposing a trustless and decentralized blockchain which enables real-time market data to be accessed easily through its chain while retaining maximum validity through the utilization of several data sources, and using a consensus agreement to determine the final accurate value. This gives traders, fund managers and investors the power to write smart contracts with the added ability of executing commands based on an underlying price of a stock, cryptocurrency and other markets.

#### 1. Hybrid Proof of Authority - Proof of Stake Model

The Proof of Authority model provides one of the highest levels of security as an attacker with unwanted connection or hacked authority can not overwhelm the entire network potentially reverting or disrupting all transactions. By allowing a trusted set of individuals to validate blocks, we dramatically lower the risk of malicious nodes trying to alter the chain with false information.

This paper introduces an architecture, the Rublix chain and the Hedge DApp which showcases the power of the Rublix Blockchain.

#### 2. Market Data Consensus Model

#### Remaining Trustless

We introduce a node layer with real-time market data integration using multiple data sources to reach value consensus.
